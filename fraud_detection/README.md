# Fraud Dectection Example

This examples' goals is to:

- Build a logistic regression model using `Scikit-learn` and `Pandas` to predict fraudulent transactions by training it on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) kaggle dataset.

- Train the data and then displayed the results accordingly. Github is currently having problems with uploading Jupiter Notebooks, for this reason, I am uploading both files, `.ipynb` and `.py` until the problem is solved.
